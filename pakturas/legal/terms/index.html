    <p>
      These terms and conditions ("Terms and Conditions") are made between FATURA APP ("we", "us", "our"), and users who (i) use our website in its entirety, including all of our subpages, associated sites or pages ("Website") and/or the FATURA APP mobile or web app, which is accessible through browser on mobile phone, tablet computer and personal computer ("App") (collectively, "FATURA APP"), (ii) download software for FATURA APP ("FATURA APP Software"), and/or (iii) use, access, or purchase in App products and services provided by FATURA APP ("you", "User").

    <p>You acknowledge and agree that the availability of FATURA APP and the FATURA APP Software is dependent on the third party from which you received the FATURA APP Software (e.g., Apple App Store, or Google Play (each, "App Store")). You acknowledge that the Agreement is between you and us and not with the App Store. Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before using or accessing FATURA APP or downloading the FATURA APP Software.</p>

    <p>It is your responsibility to provide us with an up-to-date email address and to check from time to time for changes to the Agreement. By continuing to use FATURA APP following the dispatch of an email to you containing notice of changes to the Agreement, or after notice of such alterations was posted on FATURA APP, your binding acceptance of these alterations is constituted, and agreement that such alterations shall automatically come into effect 10 days after our email giving notice to you was sent, or 10 days after notice of the changes was posted on FATURA APP, is given.</p>

      <li>to disable any User’s access to FATURA APP, or to close any User’s account, for any reason and without any notice;</li>
      <li>to refuse access to any User for any reason, without notice.</li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>8. FATURA APP subscription, subscription cancellation, payments</h2>
    <p>You should know the following about FATURA APP subscriptions and our recurring payments policy when payment is made:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To access and use all FATURA APP features, you must activate a subscription. You will always be explicitly informed, stating the final prices and duration of the requested subscription and/or individual service(s), before your selected subscription and or individual service is billed through your provided form of payment. Some users might be granted a free subscription based on our discretion and specific internal criteria.</li>
      <li>After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period.</li>
      <li>All payments made to us are final and all charges are non-refundable.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We occasionally provide special offers with discounts. The terms of each offer are described on the page from which the user can proceed to the payment. Terms, discounts, and offers are subject to change or cancellation at any time without notice.</p>
    <p>With an active subscription, the promotional price may be valid either for a limited time or indefinitely. In case the obtained promotional price is indefinite with an active subscription, the price will revert to the standard price once you unsubscribe.</p>
    <p>If you have an account set up for recurring billing, you may cancel your subscription at any time. To cancel the subscription, you can follow the procedure to turn off auto-renew in your personal account settings in the mobile app under the "Subscription management" section or by clicking the cancellation link in the subscription menu on the web app. Subscriptions can only be canceled on the same platform they were bought on. Cancellations of your subscription will be effective for the following billing period in which payment is due. You will not receive a refund for any payment amount, even if payment was made for multiple billing periods. Deleting the app or your account is not enough to cancel the subscription.</p>
    <p>You will continue to have the same access for any billing period or periods for which you have paid. If your User Submissions or your conduct within FATURA APP violates the Agreement, your access and account may be immediately terminated and all payments forfeited.</p>
    <p>Along with the subscription, FATURA APP provides special features, available as in App purchases that will give certain advantages and improve experience. Users are able to purchase a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, revocable, limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and personal license to use virtual titles, gifts, coins or any other units that are provided by FATURA APP on the platform and can be exchanged for any other virtual good within the App (collectively, "Virtual Goods"). Every User can always see the balance of Virtual Goods in the settings of their profile, which represents a measurement of the extent of the User's license but does not reflect stored value nor does it constitute a real-world balance. Following the fact that Users' purchased license is revocable, FATURA APP is eligible to terminate the license when an account is terminated or closed according to the provisions of this Agreement. Users are aware and comply with the fact that FATURA APP will neither refund nor is required to refund purchased Virtual Goods for any reason that may occur (whether in the virtual or physical world), meaning all purchases are final and non refundable. Additionally, FATURA APP will neither provide nor is required to provide a refund or any other compensation for Virtual Goods when the User's account is either voluntarily closed or terminated according to the provisions of this Agreement. Virtual Goods can be modified, eliminated, controlled, regulated, managed and adjusted in terms of price by FATURA APP at any time at its sole discretion.</p>

    <h4>a. Subscriptions, payments and refunds via Apple, or Google</h4>
    <p>Your rights regarding payment policy and refunds, when purchases of subscriptions and Virtual Goods are handled by Apple, Google or Huawei, can be found in the payment policies of FATURA APP's application providers:</p>

    <p>By using third party applications that connect with FATURA APP ("Third Party Applications"), you acknowledge and agree that we may transmit User Submissions to Third Party Websites or Third Party Applications through application protocol interfaces developed and maintained by those Third Party Websites or Third Party Applications. We are not responsible for the transmission of the User Submissions from FATURA APP to Third Party Websites or Third Party Applications, nor the use of the User Submissions on any Third Party Websites or Third Party Applications.

    <h2>10. Modifying FATURA APP, termination and the appeal</h2>
    <p>You acknowledge that we may release updated versions of FATURA APP at any time we deem appropriate, adding new features or enhancements or removing features. You consent to automatic upgrades on your mobile device and agree that the terms and conditions of the Agreement will apply to all such upgrades. You agree that we will not be liable to you for any such modifications.</p>

You agree that any termination of your access to FATURA APP or any account you may have on FATURA APP, or component thereof may be effected without prior notice, and you agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any such termination.</p>
    <p>If you believe that revoking your license, any authorization to access and/or use FATURA APP and terminating your account for failure to comply with our rules on minimum required user age per terms of this Agreement is unjustifiable, please contact <a href="mailto:support@supernova-ltd.freshdesk.com" target="_blank">support@supernova-ltd.freshdesk.com</a> or use available in App mechanism to directly appeal the decision. You will have to verify your age and compliance with terms of our Agreement by providing us with a Photographic image of you and your form of identification that can confirm the date of your birth.</p>
    <p>You may terminate your account by canceling your subscription as described in section 8 above and deleting your account on the Settings screen in the app under the section My Account/ID.</p>
