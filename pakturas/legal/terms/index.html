      through browser on mobile phone, tablet computer and personal computer
      ("App") (collectively, "Pakturas"), (ii) download software for Pakturas
      APP ("Pakturas Software"), and/or (iii) use, access, or purchase in App
      products and services provided by Pakturas ("you", "User").
    </p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms and Conditions</h2>

      Please read the following Terms and Conditions carefully before using

      Store. Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you
      must agree before using or accessing Pakturas APP or downloading the
      Pakturas Software.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not accept and agree to be bound by all the terms of the

      intellectual property, including related intellectual property rights
      (including but not limited to patents, copyrights, trademarks, designs,
      any registration thereof and pending applications therefor), irrespective
      of their form and whether registerable or legally protectable relating to
      Pakturas and the Pakturas Software (collectively, "Materials").
    </p>
    <p>

      incorporated in the Materials, such open-source code is covered by the
      applicable open source or third-party end user license, if any,
      authorizing use of such code. Nothing in the Agreement limits your rights
      under, or grants you rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of
      any applicable end user license for such open-source software.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Pakturas subscription, subscription cancellation, payments</h2>
    <p>
      You should know the following about Pakturas subscriptions and our
      recurring payments policy when payment is made:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To access and use all Pakturas features, you must activate a
        subscription. You will always be explicitly informed, stating the final
        prices and duration of the requested subscription and/or individual
        service(s), before your selected subscription and or individual service
        is billed through your provided form of payment. Some users might be
        granted a free subscription based on our discretion and specific
        internal criteria.
      </li>
      <li>
        After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent
        subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for
        an additional equivalent period.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We occasionally provide special offers with discounts. The terms of each
      offer are described on the screen from which the user can proceed to the
      payment. Terms, discounts, and offers are subject to change or
      cancellation at any time without notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an active subscription, the promotional price may be valid either for
      a limited time or indefinitely. In case the obtained promotional price is
      indefinite with an active subscription, the price will revert to the
      standard price once you unsubscribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may cancel your subscription at any time. To cancel the subscription,
      you can follow the procedure to turn off auto-renew in your personal
      account App Store app. Cancellations of your subscription will be
      effective for the following billing period in which payment is due.
      Deleting the app is not enough to cancel the subscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will continue to have the same access for any billing period or
      periods for which you have paid. If your User Submissions or your conduct
      within Pakturas violates the Agreement, your access may be immediately
      terminated and all payments forfeited.
    </p>

    <h4>a. Subscriptions, payments and refunds via Apple</h4>

      Subscriptions are handled by Apple, can be found in the payment policies

      implied warranties regarding the information, material, products, or
      services that are contained on or accessible through linked sites. Access
      and use of linked sites, including information, material, products, and
      services on linked sites or available through linked sites is solely at
      your own risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in
      promotions of, advertisers found on or through Pakturas are solely between
      you and such advertiser. You agree that we shall not be responsible or

      such dealings or as the result of the presence of such advertisers on
      Pakturas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parties other than us may provide services or sell products through
      Pakturas. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do
      not warrant the offerings of any of these businesses, nor the content of
      their product and service offerings. We do not assume any responsibility
      or liability for the actions, product, or content of these or any other
      third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and
      other terms and conditions of use.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Modifying Pakturas, termination and the appeal</h2>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that we may release updated versions of Pakturas at any
      time we deem appropriate, adding new features or enhancements or removing
      features. You consent to automatic upgrades on your mobile device and
      agree that the terms and conditions of the Agreement will apply to all
      such upgrades. You agree that we will not be liable to you for any such
      modifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we believe in good faith that you have violated any of the terms and
      conditions of the Agreement or any applicable law, we may terminate your
      use of Pakturas or any component thereof and remove and discard all or any
      part of your User Submissions, at any time and at our discretion. You
      agree that any termination of your access to Pakturas or any component
      thereof may be effected without prior notice, and you agree that we will
      not be liable to you or any third party for any such termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you believe that revoking your license, any authorization to access
      and/or use Pakturas and terminating your subscription for failure to
      comply with our rules on minimum required user age per terms of this
      Agreement is unjustifiable, please contact
      <a href="mailto:hello@iosstud.io" target="_blank">hello@iosstud.io</a>
      or use available in App mechanism to directly appeal the decision. You
      will have to verify your age and compliance with terms of our Agreement by
      providing us with identification that can confirm the date of your birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may terminate your subscription as described in section 7 above and
      deleting the app.

      including legal fees, brought by a third party arising out of or related

    <h2>13. Severability</h2>
    <p>
      If any provision of the Agreement shall be partially or fully invalid or
      for any reason unenforceable, the validity of the other provisions of the
      Agreement shall not be affected thereby. The invalid or unenforceable
      provision shall be replaced by a provision that economically best achieves
      the objectives of the parties.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Waiver</h2>
    <p>
      A provision of the Agreement may be waived only by a written instrument
      executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision. The
      failure of any party at any time to require performance of any provision
      of this Agreement shall in no manner affect such party's right later to
      enforce the same. A waiver of any breach of any provision of the Agreement
      shall not be construed as a continuing waiver of other breaches of the
      same or other provisions of the Agreement.
    </p>
