          <p>
            The Application collects log data to monitor app performance and
            diagnose issues. This may include technical information such as
            error reports, usage events, or system diagnostics. Logs are
            collected and stored using Google App Engine, a third-party service.

          <p>
            The app does not collect, store, or process personal data or

          <p>
            In addition, RevenueCat is used for anonymized purchase tracking.

            that a purchase was made at a particular time in a particular
            country; no other data is collected, and so this purchase data
            cannot be linked to a user’s identity. For more information on how
            RevenueCat handles data, please review their privacy policy at
